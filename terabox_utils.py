# --- IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER ---
# The following function is a BASIC PLACEHOLDER and LIKELY WILL NOT WORK
# reliably with the real Terabox website. Terabox uses complex methods
# (JavaScript, dynamic loading, captchas, cookies, changing HTML) to prevent
# scraping. You will need to replace this with a robust scraping solution,
# possibly using libraries like Selenium, Playwright, or a specialized (and
# likely unofficial/unstable) Terabox API wrapper if one exists.
# Constant maintenance will likely be required.
